JustDockIt is a cheaty solution to a mundane and repetitive problem in Kerbal Space Program -- docking two vehicles together. This mod is licenced under **CC-BY 4.0**.

To install, simply unpack the release archive to the KSP folder.

To use it:
1. Perform a rendezvous. Or use the Debug menu, I'm not police.
2. Select a docking port on a source vessel and click _Control from here_.
3. Select a docking port on a target vessel and click _Set as target_.
4. Press _Ctrl + Alt + D_.

This will reposition and reorient the source vessel such that there is a small gap between the docking ports, and disables RCS and SAS. The docking port magnets will do the rest of the work.
